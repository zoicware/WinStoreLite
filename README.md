# WinStoreLite

Windows Store Lite is a powershell script that utilizes winget to enable users to download UWP and Store apps without using the Microsoft Store.

The script will first check for dependencies: Pauses and enables updates as they need to be on for winget to install apps, checks appx service is set to manual and running, checks if winget is installed

I have checkboxes for some common apps but if your desired app is not listed you can use the search box to search and install any app. 

Once the apps have been installed you can choose to set updates back to disabled or leave them paused


NOTE: IF YOUR INTERNET IS SLOW OR THE APP IS LARGE THE INSTALL PROCESS MAY TAKE LONGER THAN EXPECTED PLEASE BE PATIENT OR USE THE SKIP FUNCTION AND TRY AGAIN
